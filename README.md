  A data visulization has been performed in honor of World UFO Day! UFO sightings have been cataloged and the data is available to everyone. A webpage has been created with a dynamic table to display the UFO sightings. You can filter multiple criteria including date, City, State, Country and shape to display the sighting information.

## Summary            
  One drawback for this webpage is that the data is not activly updating. A cool improvement would be to add a map that shows the locations and information for the sightings so you could get a better idea of where the most activity is.
